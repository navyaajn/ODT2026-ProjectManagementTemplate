## 1.3 Project Title
600 Pixels

## 1.4 One-Line Pitch
A dynamic LED wall that detects movement and lights up in real time, turning simple gestures into an engaging visual experience.

## 1.5 Expanded Project Idea
In 1–2 paragraphs, explain:
- what your project is,
- what kind of playful experience it creates,
- what makes it fun, curious, engaging, strange, satisfying, competitive, or delightful,
- what technologies are involved.

**Response:**  
`This project is an interactive LED wall made using NeoPixel strips, an ultrasonic sensor, and a servo motor. The sensor scans horizontally by rotating on a servo and detects the position of a person or object in front of the wall. Based on this detection, corresponding sections of the LED strips light up, creating a direct visual response to movement. The installation is designed to be quick to engage with—people can simply walk by or wave their hand and immediately see the wall react.

The experience is playful and intriguing because it invites curiosity without demanding time or instructions. The moving sensor creates a sense of anticipation, and the real-time lighting response feels almost like the wall is “watching” or “tracking” you. Variations in lighting based on distance add a dynamic, almost disco-like effect, making it visually satisfying. The project combines hardware and software elements including an ESP32 microcontroller, NeoPixel LED strips, ultrasonic sensing, servo control, and power regulation using a buck converter.

# 2. Philosophy Fit

## 2.1 Experience, Not Social Problem
This module does **not** require your project to solve a large social problem.

You are allowed to build:
- toys,
- games,
- interactive objects,
- playful machines,
- kinetic artifacts,
- humorous devices,
- strange but delightful experiences,
- things that are entertaining to use or watch.

## 2.2 What kind of experience are you creating?
Answer the following:
- What is the experience?
- What do you want the player or participant to feel?
- Why would someone want to try it again?

**Response:**  
- The experience is an interactive wall that responds to movement in real time. As a person walks past or waves their hand, a scanning sensor detects their position and lights up corresponding sections of LED strips, creating a dynamic visual trail that follows them.
- Curiosity first—because the wall appears to “notice” them. Then surprise and delight when their movement directly affects the lights. It should feel playful, slightly mysterious, and satisfying to control without needing instructions.'
- Because the output changes based on how they move. Users can experiment—move faster, slower, closer, farther—and see different lighting patterns. This variability, combined with the instant feedback, makes it engaging and replayable.

## 3.1 References
List what inspired the project.

| Source Type | Title / Link | What Inspired You |
|---|---|---|
| Video / Interactive Installation | https://pin.it/6xYyJaCZk | The idea of a responsive light wall that reacts to human presence and creates an immediate visual connection |
| Video / Interactive Installation | (https://pin.it/6xYyJaCZk) | The scanning or tracking behaviour and how simple movement can be translated into engaging light patterns |

## 3.2 Original Twist
What makes your project original?

**Response:**  
Unlike typical LED walls that use cameras or fixed sensors, this project uses a single ultrasonic sensor mounted on a moving servo to scan space horizontally. This creates a more visible and mechanical interaction where users can actually see how the system is “searching” for them. The simplicity of using one moving sensor instead of multiple static inputs makes the interaction feel more intentional and slightly unexpected.

Additionally, the project focuses on quick engagement. It does not require instructions, controllers, or long interaction time. People can just walk by and instantly become part of the experience. The variation in lighting based on distance and position adds a dynamic, almost rhythmic visual effect, making it both interactive and visually appealing.

## 6.2 High-Level System Description
Explain how the system works in simple terms.

Include:
- input,
- processing,
- output,
- physical structure,
- app interaction if any.

**Response:**  
The system takes input through an ultrasonic sensor that detects the distance and position of a person or object. This sensor is mounted on a servo motor, which continuously scans left to right to cover the full width of the wall.

The ESP32 processes this data by mapping the detected position to specific sections of the NeoPixel LED strips. Based on this, it decides which LEDs should light up and how they should behave.

The output is a visual response where the LED strips light up in real time, following the user’s movement and creating dynamic patterns.

Physically, the system consists of horizonatally arranged NeoPixel strips forming a wall, with the sensor and servo mounted at the top. Power is managed using a 12V adapter and a buck converter to safely supply the required voltage to the components.

There is no app interaction; the system works as a standalone installation.

## 9.2 Wiring Plan
Describe the main electrical connections.

**Response:**  
**Response:**
The ESP32 acts as the central controller, with all components connected to it and sharing a common ground. A 12V adapter supplies power, which is stepped down to 5V using an LM2596 buck regulator. This 5V line powers the servo motor, ultrasonic sensor, and all NeoPixel LED strips.

The servo motor is connected to GPIO 13 for signal control, allowing it to rotate and scan left to right. The ultrasonic sensor has its trigger pin connected to GPIO 5 and its echo pin connected to GPIO 18 through a voltage divider to reduce the signal to a safe level for the ESP32.

Five NeoPixel LED strips are connected to different GPIO pins: GPIO 23 for the top strip, GPIO 22 for the second strip, GPIO 21 for the middle strip, GPIO 19 for the fourth strip, and GPIO 25 for the bottom strip. All strips receive 5V power from the buck regulator and share a common ground.

Five push buttons are connected to GPIO pins 32, 33, 26, 27, and 14. Each button is connected between the GPIO pin and ground, using the ESP32’s internal pull-up resistors. These buttons are used to trigger different animation modes such as wave, heart, rings, text, and to return to the default radar mode.

# 10. Software Planning

## 10.1 Software Tools

| Tool / Platform | Purpose |
|---|---|
| MicroPython Thonny IDE	 | Programming the ESP32 to control sensor input, servo movement, and LED output Writing, uploading, and debugging MicroPython code on the ESP32 |

## 10.2 Software Logic
Describe what the code must do.

Include:
- startup behavior,
- input handling,
- sensor reading,
- decision logic,
- output behavior,
- communication logic,
- reset behavior.

**Response:**  
Startup behavior:
On startup, the ESP32 initializes the servo, ultrasonic sensor, NeoPixel strips, and buttons. The servo begins scanning left to right.

Input handling:
The system takes input from the ultrasonic sensor for movement and from buttons for triggering animations.

Sensor reading:
The ultrasonic sensor continuously measures distance as it scans across the wall.

Decision logic:
The code maps the detected position to specific LED sections. If a button is pressed, it overrides the sensor mode and switches to animation mode.

Output behavior:
In default mode, LEDs light up based on position. In button mode, predefined pixel art or patterns are displayed for exactly 10 seconds.

Communication logic:
All components are directly controlled by the ESP32 using GPIO pins. No external communication or app is used.

Reset behavior:
After 10 seconds or a button press, the system returns to the default sensor-based interaction mode automatically.

## 12.2 Material Justification
Explain why you selected your main materials and components.

Examples:
- Why acrylic instead of cardboard?
- Why MDF instead of 3D print?
- Why servo instead of DC motor?
- Why bearing instead of a plain shaft hole?

**Response:**  
NeoPixel LED strips were chosen because they are individually addressable, making it easy to control specific sections and create dynamic patterns. An ESP32 was used as it has enough GPIO pins and processing capability to handle multiple components together.

A servo motor was selected instead of a DC motor because it allows controlled angular movement, which is needed for accurate left-to-right scanning of the sensor. The ultrasonic sensor was used as a simple and cost-effective way to detect distance without needing complex camera systems.

The LM2596 buck regulator was necessary to safely step down 12V to 5V, since the LED strips require stable voltage and higher current. A voltage divider was used to protect the ESP32 from higher voltage signals coming from the sensor.

Foam board was chosen for the structure because it is lightweight, easy to cut, and stable enough to hold the LED strips. Black paper was added to improve the visual effect by increasing contrast and making the lights stand out more.

|---|---:|
| Electronics (ESP32, NeoPixel strips, LM2596 buck regulator, ultrasonic sensor)| 2325 |
| Mechanical parts (servo motors) | 150 |
| Fabrication materials (foam board, black paper) | 200 |
| Purchased extras (wires, jumper wires, resistors) | 200 |
| Contingency (extra components / replacements)| 200 |
| **Total** | 3075 |

## 12.5 Budget Reflection
If your cost is too high, what can be simplified, removed, substituted, or shared?

**Response:**  
Costs can be reduced by borrowing components like the ultrasonic sensor, buttons, servo motors, and wires instead of purchasing them. The number of NeoPixel strips can also be reduced to make a smaller version of the installation while still maintaining the core interaction.

# 13. Planning the Work

## 13.1 Team Working Agreement
Write how your team will work together.

Include:
- how tasks are divided,
- how decisions are made,
- how progress will be checked,
- what happens if a task is delayed,
- how documentation will be maintained.

**Response:**  
Tasks are divided based on strengths. Visruta handles coding and circuit design, while Navyaa supports with debugging, coding help, and managing logistics like components and setup.

Decisions are usually mutual. If there is a disagreement, both approaches are tested and the one that works better, looks better, or fits the system more efficiently is chosen.

Progress is tracked using a basic timetable based on daily goals. Tasks are planned according to what needs to be completed by a certain time and this is generally followed.

If a task is delayed, it is usually completed the same day even if it requires working late. If progress stops due to confusion or technical issues, external help is taken before continuing.

Documentation is maintained alongside the build. While Visruta works on final coding and adjustments, Navyaa updates the repository and later handles documentation visuals like photos and videos.

# 17. Build Documentation

## 17.1 Fabrication Process
Describe how the project was physically made.

Include:
- cutting,
- 3D printing,
- assembly,
- fastening,
- wiring,
- finishing,
- revisions.

**Response:**  
The structure was made using foam board as the base because it is lightweight and easy to work with. The foam board was cut to the required size to form the wall. Black sheets were then added on top to improve the visual depth and make the LED lights stand out more clearly.

The NeoPixel strips were measured, cut, and arranged vertically on the board. They were fixed in place and then wired together carefully using jumper wires and additional red and black wires for power distribution.

The ultrasonic sensor was mounted on a servo at the top of the structure, ensuring it could scan across the full width. All components were connected to the ESP32, and wiring was adjusted multiple times during testing to fix issues with power and signal stability.

Several revisions were made during the build, especially in wiring and number of LED strips, to achieve a stable and working system.

# 18. Final Outcome

## 18.1 Final Description
Describe the final version of your project.

**Response:**  
The final project is an interactive LED wall made using 10 NeoPixel strips arranged vertically on a foam board structure. An ultrasonic sensor mounted on a servo scans left to right and detects movement in front of the wall. Based on this, corresponding sections of the LED strips light up in real time, creating a responsive visual effect.

The system also includes buttons that trigger animated pixel art patterns for exactly 10 seconds, after which the system returns to the default motion-based interaction. The setup runs using an ESP32 with proper power management through a buck regulator and stable wiring.

## 18.2 What Works Well
Real-time motion tracking and LED response feels immediate and engaging
Stable performance with 10 LED strips after resolving power issues
Button-triggered animations add variation to the interaction

## 18.3 What Still Needs Improvement
Power system can be improved to support more LED strips
Sensor tracking can be more precise and smoother
Better finishing and cleaner wiring for a more polished look

## 18.4 What Changed From the Original Plan
How did the project change from the initial idea?

# 19. Reflection

## 19.1 Team Reflection
What did your team do well?  
What slowed you down?  
How well did you manage time, tasks, and responsibilities?

**Response:**  
The final project is an interactive LED wall made using 10 NeoPixel strips arranged vertically on a foam board structure. An ultrasonic sensor mounted on a servo scans left to right and detects movement in front of the wall. Based on this, corresponding sections of the LED strips light up in real time, creating a responsive visual effect. The system also includes buttons that trigger animated pixel art patterns for exactly 10 seconds, after which it returns to the default motion-based interaction. The setup runs using an ESP32 with power managed through a buck regulator and stable wiring.

What works well is that the motion tracking and LED response feel immediate and engaging. The system is stable with 10 LED strips after resolving earlier power issues. The button-triggered animations also add variation and make the interaction more interesting.

What still needs improvement is the power system, which currently limits the number of LED strips. The sensor tracking can be smoother and more accurate, and the overall finishing, especially wiring, can be cleaner for a more polished output.

Compared to the original plan, the project was scaled down from 15 LED strips to 10 due to power and stability issues. There were multiple changes in wiring, power distribution, and components to make the system work reliably. The button-based interaction was also added later to enhance the experience, which was not part of the initial idea.


## 19.2 Technical Reflection
What did you learn about:
- electronics,
- coding,
- mechanisms,
- fabrication,
- integration?

**Response:**  
We learned that electronics requires a clear understanding of basics like voltage, current, and power, and we often had to apply 12th grade physics concepts while working on this project. It is important to always double check voltage and current before connecting components, as small mistakes can damage parts.

In coding, we learned how to map sensor input to outputs and handle multiple components together, along with debugging logic when things do not work as expected.

For mechanisms, we understood how to control precise movement using a servo and how physical positioning affects sensor accuracy.

In fabrication, we learned how to build a stable structure using simple materials and how proper placement of components affects the final result.

In integration, the biggest learning was that combining everything is the hardest part. Power distribution, wiring, and coordination between components need careful planning. We also learned to always keep spare components and handle everything carefully to avoid failures.


## 19.3 Design Reflection
What did you learn about:
- designing for play,
- delight,
- clarity,
- physical interaction,
- player understanding,
- iteration?

**Response:**  
This project helped us understand that designing for play is more about creating something that invites interaction naturally rather than forcing it. The wall works because people can just walk by and it responds, which makes it easy to approach without instructions. That simplicity is what creates curiosity and pulls people in.

We also learned that delight comes from immediate feedback. When the lights react instantly to movement, it feels satisfying and keeps people engaged. Small additions like changing patterns or animations make a big difference in keeping the experience interesting.

Clarity is important, especially in interactive systems. If users do not understand what is happening, they lose interest. We saw this when people were confused about where the sensor was or what the buttons did, which showed us that making interactions more visible or intuitive is important.

Physical interaction plays a big role because the experience depends on how people move. Different movements create different outputs, which makes it feel more personal and interactive.

Player understanding comes from observation more than explanation. If someone else uses it and understands it quickly, the design works. If not, something needs to be improved.

Iteration was the biggest part of the process. Almost nothing worked perfectly the first time. We had to keep testing, failing, and changing both the technical setup and the interaction design until it started working properly.

## 19.4 If You Had One More Week
What would you improve next?

**Response:**  
With more time, we would improve the power system to support more LED strips and scale the installation closer to the original plan. We would also explore adding simple games and interactive modes, since people suggested ideas like turning it into something similar to slither.io or Mario Kart style visuals.

Additionally, we would experiment with using the wall for different simulations, like a fireplace effect or other ambient visuals, to expand how it can be used beyond just interaction.
